# Weather app

This app is based on the MERN stack. It uses express and node to make the openweather API requests and returns it to the Vite app front end so that the API key is not exposed.

## How to run this app

`cd server` then `npm run dev`

`cd client` then `npm run dev`

*you will require your own API key* which can be obtained from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/)
