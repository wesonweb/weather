# Weather app

This app is based on the MERN stack. It uses express and node to make the openweather API requests and returns it to the Vite app front end so that the API key is not exposed.

## How to run this app

The app is still in progress...

### start the server

- `cd server`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

### start Vite

return to the root folder and then type into the terminal

- `cd client`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

*you will require your own API key* which can be obtained from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/)
